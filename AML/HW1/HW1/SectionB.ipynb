This is done by creating ten experiments where one fold is taken to be a “test” set and the remaining nine are together considered to be the “training” set. A model is fit on the training data and asked to make predictions of the test set. For a given model, this produces ten log probability numbers that reflect how well the model generalized to the unseen data. If the folds are of different size, the predictive log probabilities can be turned into “averages” by dividing the overall logprob by the number of test cases. Perform this procedure for your Gaussian histogram density estimators from Problem 1 and 2. That is, fit this model ten times on 9/10ths of the data and ask it to make predictions of the remaining 1/10th. To visualize the results, produce a boxplot of the average log probabilities."
